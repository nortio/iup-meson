# IUP with Meson build system

The title is descriptive enough. The original library is [here](https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/): go there if you want to understand what this library is for.

Many tools and libraries are not currently integrated, but the core library works well enough. You can even cross compile it to Windows from Linux (with the `cross/mingw-w64.txt` file).
